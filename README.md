# Multimodal survival prediction for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for our '' 2024 paper, "_End-to-end prognostication in pancreatic cancer by multimodal deep learning: a retrospective, multi-centre study_". This project was developed by the [Diagnostic Image Analysis Group](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/) at Radboud University Medical Center.

## Highlights

In our study, we explore the integration of clinical data and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) at time of diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) to enhance patient survival prediction. We focus on addressing two key challenges: (1) developing unimodal AI models for clinical data and CECT scans (2) developing a multimodal AI system combining the short-term survival riskscores of both unimodal models. Our proposed model surpasses the current TNM stagig system in providing prognosis, showcasing stable performance across two external validation cohorts.
